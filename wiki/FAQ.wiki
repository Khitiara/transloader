=Frequently Asked Questions=

===Where's the documentation?===
The [Tutorial] provides a nice introduction while the  [http://transloader.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/maven/site/apidocs/index.html JavaDoc] gives all the details.

===Is Transloader Production-ready?===
Well, I (Jeremy) haven't used it in Production yet (hopefully one day soon), but it's quite well tested so it probably _should_ work for you. I'd recommend you write some integration tests around your use of it but from my tests I expect it to work well.

===Can I help at all?===
Yes!
 * Use the library and let me know what you think and where it could be improved.
 * Raise an [http://code.google.com/p/transloader/issues/entry Issue] for anything you find broken.
 * Check out the [http://transloader.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/maven/site/taglist.html TODOs] to see actual code contributions that would already be welcomed.
 * Email [mailto:jeremywales@gmail.com me] to let me know any other way you might like to help.
